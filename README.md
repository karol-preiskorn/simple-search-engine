## About 

Create your own search engine! It probably won’t compete with Google: yours will be a simple version which processes some data and searches it for a word or a phrase. Simple but cool.

## Learning outcomes
Gain confidence in working with files and console, and learn how to optimize the search process.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
Set two strings (where to search and what to search) for the program to return an index of the searched word or report “not found”

#
With the help of arrays and linear search, add more strings to the program and search for specific data from that input.


Using switch operator and methods, create a user menu for your search engine


Enable your search engine to search for data stored in the files


Working with lists and maps, build the inverted index to enhance your search


Get familiar with patterns and learn to deal with more complex types of search
